# Berry's cafe and restaurant.

BY Zawadi 

My site is a  cafe, bakery and restaurant that specializes in  Italian cuisines as well as a wide variety of desserts and pastries.
Most restaurants around offer fast food and very few dare to venture into specified cuisines which is why Berryâ€™s comes to the rescue for the foodies that just love,love, love authentic food.
The bold fusion of  Italian flavors is an experience like no other.

 ## features
 . A menu of the various items the cafe has to offer 
. A gallery of the food available
. About section with all there is to know about the cafe
. A booking section where the customers can make a reservation 
. Contact information that includes the location, emails numbers and social media account for the cafe

## Execution
The site uses css to animate the home section such that upon entering the site two boxes; one white and the other yellow, are lowered giving the optical illusion of a tick being lowered.
The popular food section is styled in such a way that once a mouse hovered over an image the image is enlarged slightly for easier viewing.
The gallery is styled in a similar way as the popular section and whenever a mouse hovers over an image, a slightly black but transluscent screen goes over an image with the name of the food.
The search bar retrieves data of the item that is searched from the api and displays the items that match.
